Program 1 is designed to show an example of a scope error. 

Program 2 is designed to show an integer overflow error, as well as try to trip them up
    by going right after the previous example by showing how scope actually works with 'x'

Program 3 shows erros in the boolean expressions by using assignment. Essentially, those
    expressions are the same as using an int as a bool value. Anything other than 0 in c++
    is true, which is why those expressions evaluate to true.

Porgram 4 is designed to show an incorrect method of assigning a new value to a variable

Program 5 - I have forgotten. If I remember, I will add their explanations. I think I 
    changed them during the session, so I don't think they're what I originally had anyways.
    As of right now, it looks correct.
